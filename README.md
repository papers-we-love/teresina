# Teresina

This is the repository for the Teresina chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/teresina/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss in a low ego, friendly environment. We'll be using and improving papers-we-love's curated repository. Please contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories. We will be recording talks, if possible, and they will appear on the shared Youtube account. Please read and follow the Code Of Conduct, please let one of the organizers know if anything makes you uncomfortable.
